# Florb
## totally revolutionary knockoff twitter

Florb now comes with
- Sign up (incredibly unsecure)
- Log in (also, incredibly unsecure)
- post creation features (add titles, text, tags, videos, or pictures)

you CAN try the version of florb that was published if you want, but be aware that your information is stored on plain text on a database literally anyone has access to:
[visit at your own risk](https://florb.web.app/app/app.html)

florb is under the GNU GPL 2.0 License allowing you to use florb for whatever purpose you can think of under the conditions that you make your source code available to everyone you distribute florb to, and that code must be provided under the same license

it is highly **NOT** recommended to use florb for anything due to how insecure it is:
- database keys publicly available on the site
- user username and password available in plain text, on database whose keys are publicly available on the site (view above :/)
- it was written really badly and loads the entire database of posts at once (bad for performance)
- it does not work on mobile, or PCs with small screen sizes (images do not scale properly)

a fork of florb called florb-v2 is in development and will be released to its own repository which will be linked in this readme (when it actually releases, which looks like never).

_florb has no relation to the firefox-based web browser [floorp](https://floorp.app), they are their own thing_

<sub>if you have a problem with the name of this project, reach out via lemiondx@gmail.com and i'll rename it to something else, i'm REALLY bad with names tho</sub>
